## Installation

You'll need Node.JS to use this project.
    
## Usage

To setup, please use node.js. Open the integrated terminal in the root of the project and type "npm i". This will install: dotenv, express, mysql, and sequelize. You'll need to setup your database using your preferred program. For this project I used MySQL. You'll then type "npm run seed". This will cause the "seeds" folder to execute and populate the database with starter information to make sure everything is running smoothly. Feel free to change or delete this files. You'll then use "npm start" to run the server through your localhost. Then use an app like InsomniaCore to check your api routes. Then you should be all set!
